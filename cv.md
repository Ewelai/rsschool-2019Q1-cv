3. About: My goal is to get as many useful professional skills in the field of web development as possible. I want to start my career as a Junior web developer and EPAM, as I am attracted to the company's ambitions and the opportunity for further development in programming and personal growth. I'm proving my skills constantly and I'm not going to stop there. I quickly assimilate the information and try to apply it in practice immediately. Since childhood I have been showing interest to the technique and to everything connected with it.Programming is also not an exception. At the moment I'm reading a book "Computer Science Distilled" by Wladston Ferreira Filho and the second part of https://learn.javascript.ru.
